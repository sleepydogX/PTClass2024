# 1.1 - Purple teaming plan

**Lab 1: Create a Purple Teaming Plan on a Template**

**Objective**: Develop a purple teaming plan using a provided template.

**Steps**:

1.	**Download Template**:

•	Use the provided purple teaming plan template or create one based on your organization’s needs. Use this: 

[Operational-Data-Template1.docx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17373341/Operational-Data-Template1.docx)


2.	**Review the following sections and complete with data:**

•	Section 2 - OPERATIONAL DETAILS

•	Section 3- ROLES

•	Section 4 - ENVIRONMENT **(do not include data here yet)**

•	Section 5 - OPERATION EVENTS **(do not include data here yet)**

•	Section 6 - ANALYSIS **(do not include data here yet)**

•	Section 7 - USEFUL FILES **(do not include data here yet)**

•	Section 8 - MALWARE **(do not include data here yet)**

•	Section 9 - MISCELLANEOUS **(do not include data here yet)**

1. In the template, add these new sections based on the following case:

> DANTY Corporation is a mid-sized financial services company facing increased phishing attempts targeting employees. The company’s cybersecurity CISO wants to organise a purple teaming exercise to simulate a sophisticated phishing campaign aimed at testing and enhancing their defenses. This simulation will include multiple TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) to assess their security posture comprehensively.
> 

1. **Objectives of Campaign:**
    1. Specify the objectives of the purple teaming exercise, such as testing specific TTPs or evaluating incident response.
2. **Identify Stakeholders**:
    1. List the members of the red, blue, and purple teams, along with their roles and responsibilities.
3. **Select TTPs**:
    1. Identify the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) from the MITRE ATT&CK framework that will be simulated.

**Expected Outcome**: A comprehensive purple teaming plan ready for execution.

## SOLUTION:

You can use https://engage.mitre.org/matrix/ to facilite the initial mapping

1. Create a Template for the engagement
2. Sections to be created:

1.	**Objectives**:

•	Evaluate the effectiveness of XYZ Corporation’s email security and endpoint defenses.

•	Assess the organization’s response to phishing and post-exploitation activities.

•	Test and refine the incident response process for detecting and mitigating advanced threats.

2.	**Stakeholders**:

•	**Red Team**: External penetration testing team responsible for designing and executing the phishing simulation.

•	**Blue Team**: XYZ Corporation’s internal IT, cybersecurity teams, and SOC (Security Operations Center) responsible for detecting and responding to the simulated attack.

•	**Purple Team Coordinator**: Responsible for orchestrating the collaboration between red and blue teams and ensuring alignment with exercise objectives.

3.	**Selected TTPs**:

•	**Phishing (T1566.001 - Spear Phishing Attachment)**:

•	The red team will craft a spear-phishing email with a malicious attachment that mimics a legitimate business document.

•	**User Execution (T1204.002 - Malicious File)**:

•	Once the attachment is opened, it will execute a script designed to establish a connection with the attacker’s C2 (Command and Control) server.

•	**Command and Control (T1071.001 - Application Layer Protocol)**:

•	The script will establish a covert communication channel with the C2 server over HTTPS to blend in with normal web traffic.

•	**Credential Dumping (T1003.001 - LSASS Memory)**:

•	If initial exploitation is successful, the red team will attempt to dump credentials from the compromised machine’s LSASS memory.

•	**Lateral Movement (T1021.001 - Remote Services: SMB/Windows Admin Shares)**:

•	Using the stolen credentials, the red team will attempt to move laterally within the network to access sensitive financial databases.

•	**Exfiltration (T1048.002 - Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol)**:

•	Data exfiltration will be simulated by transferring a small amount of dummy data over an encrypted channel.
